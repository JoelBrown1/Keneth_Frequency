# Keneth Frequency — Sprint Development Plan
**Version 0.2** — Updated to address all issues in §24 Development Issues Assessment

---

## Overview

This plan organises the Keneth Frequency Flutter application into 13 two-week sprints. Each sprint has a focused goal, a set of deliverables, and a clear definition of done. Sprints build sequentially — each depends on the previous sprint's deliverables being complete and passing tests.

**Total estimated duration:** 26 weeks (~6.5 months)
**Team assumption:** 1–2 developers
**Arch reference:** `keneth_frequency_arch.md`
**Spec reference:** `keneth_frequency_specs.md`

- All `pubspec.yaml` dependencies resolved with no version conflicts
- Directory structure matches §6 skeleton
- macOS audio entitlements configured
- `build_runner` code generation working (Riverpod + Drift)
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline configured and green from day one

## Sprint 2 — DSP Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Implement the full post-recording DSP pipeline. The pocketfft `.dylib` compiled in Sprint 0 is wrapped in FFI bindings. The pipeline runs entirely within a single Dart Isolate — no native pointers cross Isolate boundaries. SNR validation is included.

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Arch sections:** §4.2 (DSP) · §7 · §17
**Depends on:** Sprint 1; Sprint 0 pocketfft spike confirmed
**Issues addressed:** C-01 (complete — compiled .dylib), C-03 (Isolate boundary safety), M-04 (SNR check)

### Deliverables

- `FftProcessor` — FFT via `dart:ffi` → compiled pocketfft `.dylib`; all FFI allocation/deallocation within the same call, no `Pointer<T>` returned
- `WindowFunctions` — Hann and Blackman-Harris
- `FrequencyResponseBuilder` — calibration subtraction, trimming to 20 Hz–20 kHz
- `Smoothing` — 1/6 octave fractional octave smoothing; output is a fixed ~1000 log-spaced points for display
- `SignalValidator` — clip detection, silence detection, SNR check
- DSP pipeline runnable in a Dart `Isolate` via `compute()` using plain Dart types only
- Unit tests for all DSP components

| S2-11 | Wrap full pipeline in `_runDspPipeline(DspPipelineInput) → DspPipelineOutput` top-level function | C-03 | Input and output are plain Dart types only — `Float32List`, `List<double>`, no `Pointer<T>` |
| S2-12 | Write unit tests: `fft_processor_test.dart` | C-01 | 1 kHz sine at 48 kHz → peak within ±1 bin |
| S2-13 | Write unit tests: `signal_validator_test.dart` | M-04 | Clipped buffer → `checkClip` true; silence buffer → `checkSilence` true; low-SNR response → SNR < 10 dB |
| S2-14 | Write unit tests: `frequency_response_builder_test.dart` | — | Synthetic spectrum + calibration → verify subtraction and trimming |
| S2-15 | Write integration test: synthetic sweep PCM → full DSP pipeline → peak at known frequency | — | Use `PeakDetector` end-to-end |

### Definition of Done
